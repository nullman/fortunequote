FortuneQuote
================================================================================

FortuneQuote is a version of the old *nix fortune program for Android.

Some features:

 * Display random fortunes from 44 topics and over 15,000 fortunes
 * Create fortune widgets on the home screen with periodic updates
 * Set a periodic notification with a new fortune
 * Pick which topics to pull from
 * Adjust the font type, style, and size (in main app only)

The first time you run the application it loads the fortunes into its internal
database. This process may take about 5 minutes to complete, however, you can
use the application as soon as the first topic has been loaded (which is
usually within 10-30 seconds).

Create project from existing source and set the location to your
FortuneQuote/trunk directory.

Click Finish and you should be all setup.

Once you have an emulator running, just run the application.
